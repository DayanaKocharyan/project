Welcome to one of our "Getting Started" competitions ðŸ‘‹

This particular challenge is perfect for data scientists looking to get started with Natural Language Processing. The competition dataset is not too big, and even if you donâ€™t have much personal computing power, you can do all of the work in our free, no-setup, Jupyter Notebooks environment called Kaggle Notebooks.

Competition Description

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, itâ€™s not always clear whether a personâ€™s words are actually announcing a disaster.
